## Copy Notes for Implementation

### Voice Consistency
- Use active voice: "Ark automates workflows" not "Workflows are automated by Ark"
- Lead with outcomes: "Cut lead response time to under 60 seconds" not "Improve lead management"
- Be specific: "DMS, CRM, SIP, KYC, EMR/EHR, PACS/RIS" not "your systems"

### Responsive Copy Adjustments
- **Mobile hero:** Shorten subheadline if needed for readability
- **Mobile sector cards:** Keep to 2–3 pain points max
- **Mobile case study cards:** Show metric headline + 1-sentence impact only

### Localization Hooks (if needed later)
- Domain terms (DMS, KYC, SIP, NIGO, TAT) are standard in India/Asia but may need light explanation for other markets
- Compliance references (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA) can be swapped based on primary market

### A/B Test Ideas
- Hero headline: "Enterprise AI that moves at the speed of your operations" vs. "Cut lead response time, TAT, and manual work—without changing your systems"
- CTA: "Book a Demo" vs. "See Ark in Action"
- Case study cards: Metric-first vs. Story-first layout
