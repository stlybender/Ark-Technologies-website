# Ark Enterprise AI – Homepage Information Architecture

## Overview
A clean, Apple-like scroll experience that moves from **what we do** → **how we do it** → **proof** → **action**. Each section builds credibility through concrete examples and sector-specific language.

---

## Section-by-Section Structure

### 1. Hero
**Goal:** Immediate clarity on what Ark does and for whom.

**Elements:**
- **Headline** (1 line): Sharp statement of Ark's value
- **Subheadline** (1–2 lines): Supporting detail with specificity
- **Primary CTA**: "Book a Demo" or "See How It Works"
- **Visual**: Clean, minimal background with subtle motion (parallax or soft fade)

**Copy hooks:**
- Enterprise AI for operations-heavy industries
- Mention specific outcomes (lead response time, KYC automation, EMR efficiency)
- Avoid generic "AI solution" language

---

### 2. Trust Signals / Logos
**Goal:** Quick credibility through recognizable names or compliance badges.

**Elements:**
- Client logos (if available) or sector indicators ("Trusted by real estate developers, wealth managers, hospital networks")
- Compliance/security badges (ISO, SOC2, data residency)
- Simple, single-row layout on light background

---

### 3. Problem → Solution (By Sector)
**Goal:** Show sector-specific understanding and measurable outcomes.

**Layout:** 3-column grid (desktop) or stacked cards (mobile), one per primary sector.

**Sectors to highlight:**
1. **Real Estate**
   - Problem: Slow lead response, manual calling, poor funnel visibility
   - Outcome: Lead response time cut to under 60 seconds, higher site-visit booking rates
   
2. **Banking & Wealth**
   - Problem: Manual KYC/MF forms, slow SIP registration, generic investor communication
   - Outcome: Faster onboarding, fewer NIGO cases, higher engagement
   
3. **Healthcare**
   - Problem: Overburdened doctors, free-text reports, poor operational visibility
   - Outcome: Reduced documentation time, improved radiology TAT, better EMR data quality

**Optional 4th column or expandable:**
- **Automotive**: Missed calls, low test-drive conversion, incomplete DMS/CRM data → Fewer missed calls, higher booking rates

**Copy pattern per card:**
- Sector name + icon
- 2–3 specific pain points (using domain language: DMS, KYC, SIP, EMR/EHR, PACS/RIS)
- 1 sentence on Ark's solution
- 1–2 directional metrics

---

### 4. Platform Capabilities
**Goal:** Show the technical depth without overwhelming.

**Layout:** Feature grid or horizontal scroll with icons.

**Capabilities to highlight:**
- **Data Ingestion:** Connect to DMS, CRM, SIP logs, EMR/EHR, PACS/RIS, and more
- **Intelligent Automation:** AI Voice CRM, calling assistants, document automation (IDP/OCR), prescription assistants
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Auto-schedule site visits, test drives, service appointments; manage KYC/SIP flows
- **AI Copilots:** Chatbots for investors, portfolio intelligence, radiology insights
- **Analytics & Dashboards:** Real-time funnel visibility, radiology TAT, modality utilization, compliance reporting

**Copy:** Short, benefit-driven descriptions with real integration examples.

### 5. How It Works
