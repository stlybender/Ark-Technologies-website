## Content Highlights

### Hero Headline
**"Enterprise AI that moves at the speed of your operations."**

### Core Value Pillars
1. **Speed Where It Matters** – Lead response time cut to under 60 seconds
2. **Data That Works for You** – Clean, structured intelligence from fragmented sources
3. **Compliance Without Compromise** – Built for regulated industries (KYC/AML, EMR/EHR)

### Case Study Metrics (Ready to Showcase)
- **Real Estate:** Lead response time → under 60 seconds
- **Automotive:** Fewer missed calls during peak load
- **Banking/Wealth:** Faster onboarding, lower NIGO rates
- **Healthcare – OPD:** Reduced documentation time per patient
- **Healthcare – Radiology:** Improved radiology TAT and utilization

---

## Design Highlights

### Visual Philosophy
**Clean. Confident. Concrete.**

- Ultra-minimal, Apple-like aesthetic
- Generous white space (128px between sections on desktop)
- Subtle animations (400ms fade-ins, 250ms transitions)
- Deep blue accent color (`#1E40AF`) – premium, trustworthy, not startup-y
- System fonts for fast load and native feel

### Key Design Decisions
- **No purple-pink gradients** (as requested)
- **No flashy animations** – only purposeful, subtle motion
- **Typography-first** – clean hierarchy with comfortable line heights
- **Mobile-first responsive** – stacked layouts, horizontal scroll for cards
- **Accessibility-first** – WCAG AA compliant, keyboard navigable

---
